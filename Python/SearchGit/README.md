# Introduction 
This script is for searching over a group of Git Repositories.

The Repositories must be cloned into a directory to be searched over.

Example:
Make a directory for cloning into.

D:\ClonedRepos

Clone the repos you want to search over into this directory.

# Getting Started
There are some values in SearchGitRepos.py that the user will need to update to use this script:
1.	config.BASEDIR
2.	config.LogPath
